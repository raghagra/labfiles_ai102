      "Silicon Valley Bank's collapse was caused by bad decisions and a rapid increase in interest rates. The bank had two weird features on its balance sheet; it was almost entirely funded by business depositors, who demand more interest when interest rates go up, and they bought Treasury bonds which have fixed interests. When the price of money went up but the assets' price did not, Silicon Valley Bank watched its profits disappear leading to depositors pulling their funds out and hence a run on the bank. However, this is not another 2008 financial crisis because SVB looks like an outlier with poor balance sheet management that other banks do not share to such a degree. Furthermore, unlike 2008 where there were all these terrible loans undercapitalised on housing that melted down causing credit event(s), there is no credit event per se here as we learned from last time around that even world's largest financial institutions were inadequately capitalised while this time around big banks are much better capitalised.\n",
      "<|im_end|> The Financial Times' Robert Armstrong explains how the collapse of US lender SVB has exposed a vulnerability in smaller banks that have been buying up securities with short-term funding. He also discusses what this means for banking regulation and what entrepreneurs should be asking their lenders. While it is unlikely to cause a global financial crisis, the incident will likely prompt regulators to revisit rules around maturity transformation and could inspire consolidation among smaller banks.\n",

In this episode of Behind the Money, he explains why we shouldn't be panicking about bank runs just yet... Let's find out!<|im_end|> The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank's high-yield bond fund has raised concerns about the broader US banking system. In this episode, Robert Armstrong explains how banks make money and why it is risky. He also provides insights into what entrepreneurs should be asking their banks in the future.
